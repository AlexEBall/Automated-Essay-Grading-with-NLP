The relevant entities are identified in the text and then replaced with a string such as \"@PERSON1.\"\n",

    "\n",
    "Here are some hypothetical examples of replacements made:\n",
    "\n",
    "+ \"I attend Springfield School...\" --> \"...I attend @ORGANIZATION1\"\n",
    "+ \"once my family took my on a trip to Springfield.\" --> \"once my family took me on a trip to @LOCATION1\"\n",

Those who support advances in technology believe that computers have a positive effect on people. They teach hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people, and even allow people to talk online with other people. Others have different ideas. Some experts are concerned that people are spending too much time on their computers and less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends. Write a letter to your local newspaper in which you state your opinion on the effects computers have on people. Persuade the readers to agree with you.',\n",

But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf -- that work I abhor -- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.\" --Katherine Paterson, Author. Write a persuasive essay to a newspaper reflecting your vies on censorship in libraries.
