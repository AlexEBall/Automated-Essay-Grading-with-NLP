       "\"There were many obstacles that the builders faced in attempting to have dirigibles dock at the Empire State Building. Safety was an issue with the dirigibles because of the highly flammable gas hydrogen. So, if the dirigibles explode over New York many people could be killed in the very populated. Another problem is keeping the derigible @CAPS1 so people can get off while the wind moves the back end of itself. The only way was to tie lead weights down in the back of the dirigible, but it would be dangerous over people down below. So, these obstacles workers faced, never got past them and so they made the world's highest soda fountain and tea garden for tourists in the observation area.\""

The longer the text, the greater the chance for the author to use words that she has not used yet. You can test this hypothesis by plotting lexical diversity against the length of the texts. That, the length of the texts is the independent variable, on the X axis, against which you want to evaluate the lexical diversity of a text, the dependent variable on the Y axis. As the terminology suggests, the dependent variable depends on the independent one, which is shown quantitatively by plotting Y onto X."
